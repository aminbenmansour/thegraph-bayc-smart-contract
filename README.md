# thegraph-bayc-smart-contract
The purpose of this repo is to get familiar with `The Graph` protocol. The Graph, also known as Google of the Web3 is becoming a substantial part for querying data of the blockchain.

We will be deploying a graph of the famous NFT collection, BAYC, and eventually deploying our subgraph. 
## the graph protocol
We are seeing different actors within the protocol
* **Developers** Create a subgraph or use existing subgraphs in a dapp
* **Indexers** Operate a node to index data and serve queries
* **Curators** Organize data by signaling on subgraphs
* **Delegators** Secure the network by delegating GRT to Indexers
